/**
 * Observes app-process foreground/background transitions and flushes the
 * [EventTransport] on background. The Android analog of Swift's
 * `LifecycleObserver`.
 *
 * Swift wires `UIApplication.didEnterBackgroundNotification` /
 * `willEnterForegroundNotification` / `willTerminateNotification` and, on
 * background, acquires a `beginBackgroundTask` window to `flushAll()` before the
 * OS suspends. Android has no per-app background-task grant for a library, so
 * the analog is [ProcessLifecycleOwner] (which reports whole-process
 * foreground/background — not per-Activity), driving:
 *  - **ON_START** (foreground): bump the questionnaire foreground counter and
 *    emit `sdk:app_foregrounded`. Mirrors Swift's `willEnterForeground` handler.
 *    The process-cold-launch path doesn't double-fire because
 *    `ProcessLifecycleOwner` reports the first `ON_START` as a foreground only
 *    after the host's first real background→foreground transition is observed.
 *  - **ON_STOP** (background): emit `sdk:app_backgrounded` and run [flushAll]
 *    (when `flushOnBackground` is on) so the in-memory buffer reaches the
 *    server; on the way out also [persistBufferToDisk] so anything appended
 *    during the flush survives process death. Best-effort: Android may kill the
 *    process at any time after `ON_STOP`, so the disk persist is the durable
 *    backstop — exactly Swift's watchOS strategy (no background-task grant).
 *
 * The transport calls run on the SDK [scope]; the lifecycle callbacks
 * themselves arrive on the main thread (where [ProcessLifecycleOwner] posts).
 * Constructed + [start]ed only when `flushOnBackground` is enabled (matching
 * Swift's `if config.flushOnBackground` gate), and [stop]ped + replaced on
 * re-configure.
